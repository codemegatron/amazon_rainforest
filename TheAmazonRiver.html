            <p style='font-size:20px'>The Amazon river's length is approximately 6400km, that's about 4000 miles! It is located in South America, going through six countries:<br/>Guyana, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Columbia and Peru.</p>
            <p class="fun-fact">During the wet season, the Amazon river's width can reach over 190 kilometres. That's 120 miles!</p>
            <p>The largest city on the Amazon river is Manus. Manus is in Brazil and is home to 1.7 million people. There are no bridges across the Amazon as there is not many cities along this river (also, it would have to span 120 miles to be safe!).</p>
