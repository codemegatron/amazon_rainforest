            <p style='font-size:20px'>The Amazon river's length is approximately 6400km, that's about 4000 miles! It is located in South America, going through six countries:<br/>Guyana, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, Columbia and Peru.</p>
            <p class="fun-fact">During the wet season, the Amazon river's width can reach over 190 kilometres. That's 120 miles!</p>
            <p>In the dry season, it can be more than 10km. The mouth of the amazon is over 320 kilometres (200 miles)wide.</p>
            <p>The largest city on the Amazon river is Manus. Manus is in Brazil and is home to 1.7 million people. There are no bridges across the Amazon as there is not many cities along this river (also, it would have to span 120 miles to be safe!).</p>
            <p>There are around 3000 known species of fish that live in the river, with more constantly being discovered.</p>
            <p>There is controversy of where the Amazon originates, but alot of people think it comes from the Andes mountains in Peru. The amazon <strong>discharges</strong> 209,000 cubic metres (7,831,00ft2 or 2610333.33yrds squared).</p>
            <p class="fun-fact">the total <strong>discharge</strong> of the Amazon is bigger than the total <strong>discharge </strong>of the 7 next largest rivers!</p>
            <p>The Amazon basin (see 'The Rainforest' page) is the largest drainage basin in the world and equates for 1-fifth of the world's total river flow.</p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Quick Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Amazon river is made up of over 1100 tributaries (I can see how it would be hard to find the source of the Amazon!), 17 are longer than 1,600km (1000m)</li>
                <li>Marajo, the world's largest river island, is on the Amazon and has an area of 48,000 square kilometres (18,533 square miles, the size of Switzerland)</li>
                <li>The Amazon river flows 20% of Earth's fresh water into the Atlantic ocean.</li>
